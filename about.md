<p class="message">
  Hello there. I'm a sometime programmer, religious studies and theology student, (very) amateur musician, 
  and am currently working towards getting a number of IT certifications with a view to getting back into the industry.
</p>

I'm currently looking for work. My skillset includes (but is not limited to):-

* Linux
* Programming (most experienced in Python, but I can get stuff done in most languages with a bit of effort)
* General scripting (mostly bash, but have been trying to get up to speed with PowerShell)
* Writing documentation (unlike most people in tech, I actually enjoy doing this)

In the long run, I want to specialise and get more knowledge of network and systems administration; after I've got my CCST
Cybersecurity and CompTIA A+ certs under my belt I think I'll be aiming to study for CCNA, and possibly some of AWS and Microsoft's
cloud and dev ops certs, depending on what I end up doing.

If you want to contact me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-hughes-34448b83/) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/daihuws.bsky.social).
